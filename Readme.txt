Euler

To run the program, download the jar file and enter the following into the command prompt:
	java -jar \path\to\filename.jar

The program will then prompt the user for an input data file. Enter the file path for your desired data file.
If no file path is entered, the program will use the data file provided with the assignment.

The program will then prompt the user for  a start vertex. Once given, Fleury's algorithm will execute to find a eulerian circuit.
The program both print the results to the command prompt and save the results to a text file listed above the results.
